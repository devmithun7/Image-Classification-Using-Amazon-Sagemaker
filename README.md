# Image Classification with Amazon SageMaker

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMaker for training and deploying an image classifier. The focus is on the IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset, which includes 37 breeds of dogs and cats. We utilize SageMaker's image classification algorithm to build a model capable of accurately classifying these breeds.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Task**: Prepare the IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset for SageMaker's Image Classifier.
- **Approach**: Preprocess the images to conform to the model's input requirements.

### 2. Model Training
- **Task**: Train the image classification model using SageMaker.
- **Approach**: Utilize SageMaker's computational capabilities to achieve high accuracy in breed identification.

### 3. Model Deployment
- **Task**: Deploy the trained model on SageMaker.
- **Approach**: Enable real-time image classification, demonstrating the model's ability to distinguish between different dog and cat breeds.
